# NeuralNetwork

This program is a basic Backpropagation Neural Network using python. The program is using hours sleeping and hours studying as the inputs. Then it is using the test score the student receives as the output. The neural network is being trained through 1000 iterations and then displays the predicted output and the amount of loss between the predicted output and actual output. First the neural network needs to know the expected output and input values in the form of an array. Then it uses  forward propagation and backward propagation with the sigmoid function to calculate the weights and the predicted output.
